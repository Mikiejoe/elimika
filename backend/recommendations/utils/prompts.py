Also, include a section for practical application where possible."

PARO_SUPPORT = "Based on the child's progress report ([insert subject performance, CBC competency levels]), generate personalized home-based learning activities that align with the CBC framework. These should involve interactive, practical, and hands-on activities that parents can facilitate to reinforce classroom learning. For example, if the child is struggling with numeracy, suggest activities such as cooking measurements, counting money, or budgeting. If literacy needs improvement, suggest storytelling, reading local newspapers, or writing simple essays. Present recommendations in an easy-to-understand format for parents, including step-by-step instructions."

Identify areas where the student needs improvement and generate a brief, friendly, and encouraging message for the parent. Include practical suggestions for at-home reinforcement and simple activities that support CBC learning objectives. For example, if a student is weak in environmental science, recommend nature walks, household waste segregation, or gardening as learning reinforcements."

TUTOR_AI = "You are a virtual tutor assisting a student under the Kenyan CBC system. The student asks: '[Student Question]'. Provide an explanation using a competency-based learning approach, emphasizing real-world application. Where possible, include practical examples related to the Kenyan context (e.g., using local case studies, community-based learning, or real-life examples like agriculture, trade, and environment). Encourage critical thinking by asking follow-up questions and providing additional resources for deeper understanding."

PATH_ANALYSIS = """Analyze the following student data:

Academic performance ([insert CBC subjects & competency levels])
Practical skills ([insert extracurricular activities, project work, and hobbies])
Behavioral and personality traits ([insert available data, e.g., leadership, teamwork, creativity, problem-solving])
Interests ([insert self-reported interests or identified strengths])
Based on this information and the structure of the Kenyan education system, suggest three potential career pathways that align with the student’s strengths and interests. For each career path, include:
A brief explanation of why it suits the student.
Recommended subject focus areas to improve skills.
Suggested extracurricular activities or mentorship programs in Kenya to explore the field further."""

"Generate a personalized lesson plan for a student under the Kenyan Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC). The plan should be designed around the student's interests and preferred learning style to enhance engagement and understanding. Use the following details to tailor the plan:

Student's Interests: [Insert interests, e.g., football, music, technology, storytelling, farming]
Subject & Learning Area: [Insert subject, e.g., Mathematics, Science & Technology, Literacy, Creative Arts]
Competency Focus: [Insert CBC competency, e.g., problem-solving, critical thinking, creativity, collaboration]
Preferred Learning Style: [Insert style, e.g., visual, hands-on, storytelling, experiments, digital tools]
Structure the lesson plan as follows:

Lesson Title: A captivating title that connects the subject to the student’s interest.
Learning Outcome: Clearly defined CBC-aligned learning goals.
Introduction: A brief and engaging introduction that links the topic to the student’s interest.
Interactive Learning Activity: A hands-on, real-world application that aligns with both the subject and the student’s passion (e.g., using football statistics for a math lesson, storytelling for literacy, or coding a simple game for technology).
Practical Application: Suggest ways to apply the lesson in the student's everyday environment.
Assessment & Reflection: An engaging way to assess understanding, such as a mini-project, storytelling session, or a creative task based on the student’s interest.
Home-Based Extension: Simple activities parents can use to reinforce learning at home, ensuring alignment with CBC objectives.
Ensure the lesson is engaging, student-centered, and competency-based. If relevant, integrate digital tools, project-based learning, and problem-solving activities to enhance understanding. Present the final lesson plan in a structured and easy-to-follow format."

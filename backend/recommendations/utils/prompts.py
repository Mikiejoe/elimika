Focus on the following learning areas: [insert subject areas]. Ensure questions align with CBC strands, sub-strands, and learning outcomes. Incorporate competency-based tasks that assess critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving. Provide answers and explanations in a student-friendly format. Also, include a section for practical application where possible."

PARO_SUPPORT = "Based on the child's progress report ([insert subject performance, CBC competency levels]), generate personalized home-based learning activities that align with the CBC framework. These should involve interactive, practical, and hands-on activities that parents can facilitate to reinforce classroom learning. For example, if the child is struggling with numeracy, suggest activities such as cooking measurements, counting money, or budgeting. If literacy needs improvement, suggest storytelling, reading local newspapers, or writing simple essays. Present recommendations in an easy-to-understand format for parents, including step-by-step instructions."

Identify areas where the student needs improvement and generate a brief, friendly, and encouraging message for the parent. Include practical suggestions for at-home reinforcement and simple activities that support CBC learning objectives. For example, if a student is weak in environmental science, recommend nature walks, household waste segregation, or gardening as learning reinforcements."

TUTOR_AI = "You are a virtual tutor assisting a student under the Kenyan CBC system. The student asks: '[Student Question]'. Provide an explanation using a competency-based learning approach, emphasizing real-world application. Where possible, include practical examples related to the Kenyan context (e.g., using local case studies, community-based learning, or real-life examples like agriculture, trade, and environment). Encourage critical thinking by asking follow-up questions and providing additional resources for deeper understanding."
